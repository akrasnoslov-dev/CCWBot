# LLM Usage Reporting

`llm_usage_logs` records one row per Groq call when database storage is enabled.

Last 24h/48h usage by call type, model, and status:

```sql
SELECT
  CASE WHEN created_at >= now() - interval '24 hours' THEN '24h' ELSE '48h' END AS window,
  call_type,
  model,
  status,
  count(*) AS calls,
  sum(prompt_tokens) AS prompt_tokens,
  sum(completion_tokens) AS completion_tokens,
  sum(total_tokens) AS total_tokens,
  avg(total_tokens) AS avg_total_tokens_per_call,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'rate_limit') AS rate_limit_errors
FROM llm_usage_logs
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '48 hours'
GROUP BY 1, call_type, model, status
ORDER BY window, call_type, model, status;
```

Calls by symbol:

```sql
SELECT
  symbol,
  count(*) AS calls,
  sum(total_tokens) AS total_tokens
FROM llm_usage_logs
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '48 hours'
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY calls DESC, symbol;
```

Latest known Groq rate-limit headers by model and call type:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (model, call_type)
  model,
  call_type,
  created_at,
  rate_limit_remaining_requests,
  rate_limit_remaining_tokens,
  rate_limit_reset_requests,
  rate_limit_reset_tokens,
  retry_after
FROM llm_usage_logs
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '48 hours'
ORDER BY model, call_type, created_at DESC;
```

Recent event-analysis token averages after deployment:
